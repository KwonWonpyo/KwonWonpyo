Hi, I’m Kwon Wonpyo, living in South Korea.

I got my M.S degree on Electrical Engineering at POSTECH in 2020,
and now I’m working on TmaxOffice as a developer.

I use C++ mostly, and interested in video games, band music.
I'm learning new CS skills continuously. Currently, learning React and JavaScript.
